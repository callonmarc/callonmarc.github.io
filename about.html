  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I’m Marcus, a beginner in cybersecurity and web development.
    I’m currently learning the fundamentals of Linux, networking,
    and security through hands-on labs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy learning how systems work, building things from scratch,
    and improving my skills step by step.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is a place to document what I’m learning and
    showcase projects as I grow.
